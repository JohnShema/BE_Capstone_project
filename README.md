# Event Management API

A fully functional RESTful API for managing events and user registrations, built with Django and Django REST Framework. This project successfully implements all core requirements for the BE Capstone Project.

## ‚úÖ Project Status: COMPLETE & TESTED

All functional and technical requirements have been implemented and verified through comprehensive testing.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Management**: Complete CRUD operations with custom user model
- **Event Management**: Full CRUD operations with validation and permissions
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication system
- **Event Registration**: Capacity management with waitlist functionality
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search by title/location, filter by date and organizer
- **Permission System**: Users can only modify their own events
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Soft Delete**: Events are deactivated rather than permanently removed
- **CORS Support**: Ready for frontend integration

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Backend**: Django 4.2.7 + Django REST Framework 3.14.0
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh capability
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production ready)
- **API Design**: RESTful principles with proper HTTP status codes
- **Validation**: Comprehensive field validation and business logic

## üìã Requirements Fulfillment

### ‚úÖ Core Requirements Met:
- **Event CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete events
